Multi-Language Code Generation with Semantic Consistency

This project develops a system that translates source code from one programming language to another while preserving its original logic and functionality. The system ensures semantic consistency, generating syntactically correct and readable code in the target language.

Key Features

Code translation across multiple languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.)

Preserves program behavior and logic

AST-based code analysis and intermediate representation

Type-aware and structure-guided code generation

Automatic compilation and validation

Simple user interface for input and output

Working Process

Input source code

Parse and generate AST/Intermediate Representation

Plan translation and generate target code

Compile and validate functionality

Output refined, idiomatic code

Technologies Used

Python

AST Parsers (Python ast, JavaParser, etc.)

PyTorch / TensorFlow / Transformers (if used)

NumPy, Scikit-learn

GCC / G++ / Java Compiler

VS Code, Git, GitHub
